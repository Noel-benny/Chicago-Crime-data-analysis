Chicago Crime data analysis

ABSTRACT
Crimes are an unavoidable aspect of life in this planet. We learn about them every day, and some of us have even participated in one or more of them. Being cautious and increasing safety is no longer a straightforward guideline. To combat this issue more effectively, we need to make use of contemporary technology and data science methodologies. The police department has amassed a vast amount of records and documentation over the years, which can be used as a significant source of information for data analytics jobs. Applying analytical tasks to these data provides us with useful knowledge that we can use to improve societal safety and reduce crime.
In order to better understand the security situation in this city, we analyse the Chicago Crime dataset (between the years 2001 and 2017), one of the most comprehensive open source data sets available. Our project's findings indicate that only 28.33 percent of the reported criminals were really apprehended. As compared to a number of crimes from 2008 to 2010, the number of crimes reported in subsequent years had significantly fallen. Which demonstrates that Chicago's security has improved throughout the years. In this investigation, we also examined the connection between various crime categories and the setting in which they occurred.
The findings revealed that the top four offences in Chicago, theft, battery, and criminal property damage, accounted for 65.7% of all crimes committed there. Additionally, our findings indicate that these crimes typically occur in common locations like sidewalks, streets, apartments, and homes. We also examined the statistics of three particular crimes in our research: theft, homicide, and sexual harassment. Our findings show that there has been a consistent decrease in homicides between the years of 2001 and 2016, with an average of 482 homicides per year. But the number of homicides has sharply increased in 2016. Similar to this, there has been an upsurge in theft and sexual harassment in 2016.

Problem Definition
We came up with a few questions to help us get perspective on the security conditions in Chicago, and we addressed them during our data analysis study.
The questions are listed below:
1. How have certain offences' occurrence rates changed over time in Chicago?
2. How has the relationship between arrests and crimes altered over time in Chicago?
3. Do the offences that are being committed have any patterns?
4. What types of crimes are perpetrated most frequently?
5. Where are these crimes most frequently committed?
6. Are there specific areas with a high crime rate for specific offences (such as sexual offence)?
7. How have various crimes in Chicago changed in frequency over time, such as homicide?
We used the four primary KDD data mining pipeline steps—data preprocessing, data pre-processing, analysis, and post-processing—to provide answers to these questions .
